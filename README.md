# Progress towards my learning goals

In each folder, separated by year, are my notes, etc related to what I'm studying, doing, learning...

If you're looking to see what I'm up to, you most likely want to grab the pdf file, as I'm recording everything in latex and it's being all consolidated into [progress.pdf](2018/progress/progress.pdf).

## 2018
Learning goals:
* Javascript
* Algorithms
* Python
* Angular/Vue
* Kafka/Scala

## Progress
